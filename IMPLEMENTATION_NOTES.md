# Implementation Notes

## Changes Made

We've reorganized the code for the signature minting experience to improve maintainability and consistency. Here's a summary of the changes:

### 1. Utility Modules

- **image.js**: Consolidated image manipulation functions
- **dom.js**: Moved UI helper functions from ui-helpers.js
- **metadata.js**: Updated to match the Zora Coins EIP-7572 standard

### 2. Service Modules

- **ipfs.js**: Created a dedicated service for Pinata integration
- **blockchain.js**: Created a dedicated service for blockchain interactions
- **storage.js**: Created a dedicated service for Grove storage

### 3. Component Modules

- **modal-base.js**: Created a base class for all modals
- **signature-modal.js**: Created a unified modal for both preview and mobile drawing
- **signature-controls.js**: Updated to use the new components

### 4. Style Files

- **buttons.scss**: Added styles for buttons
- **modals.scss**: Added styles for modals
- **signature.scss**: Added styles for signature components
- **main.scss**: Created a main style file that imports all other styles

## Minting Flow

The minting flow is now consistent across both mobile and desktop:

1. User creates a signature (either by drawing on mobile or recording on desktop)
2. User clicks "Mint" in the signature modal
3. A mint form is displayed where the user can enter details like name, symbol, and payout address
4. The signature image is uploaded to IPFS via Pinata
5. Metadata is created and uploaded to IPFS following the Zora Coins EIP-7572 standard
6. The signature is minted as an NFT using the ZORA Coins SDK

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common functionality is now in shared modules
2. **Consistent User Experience**: The minting flow is now consistent across mobile and desktop
3. **Better Separation of Concerns**: UI components are separated from business logic
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error handling throughout the codebase
5. **Enhanced Metadata**: Updated metadata to follow the Zora Coins EIP-7572 standard

## SASS Updates

We've updated the SASS files to use the modern `@use` syntax instead of the deprecated `@import` syntax:

1. Created `src/styles/utils/mixins.scss` with useful mixins
2. Updated all SCSS files to use `@use` instead of `@import`
3. Added proper namespacing for mixins

## Backend Proxy for Secure API Calls

We've implemented a secure approach for handling the Pinata API calls:

1. Created a simple Express server to act as a proxy for Pinata API calls
2. Moved the Pinata JWT to the server side to keep it secure
3. Updated the IPFS service to use the proxy server instead of calling Pinata directly
4. Simplified the environment setup since we no longer need to expose the JWT to the browser

### Required Environment Variables

The environment variables are now only needed on the server side:

```
# Pinata API JWT for IPFS storage (server-side only)
PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_here
```

### Running the Application

To run the application with the proxy server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run both the frontend and backend together
npm run dev:all
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the implementation thoroughly
2. **Styling**: Refine the styles to match the design
3. **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation
4. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling
